## Detailed Description

THE FIRST SITE BLOCKER WITH AN AI BOUNCER

Instead of outright blocking distracting sites, our AI bouncer asks WHY you want to visit. Based on your reasoning, it either blocks access or grants a specific duration. No manual timers. No workarounds. No willpower battles.

THE SECRET? TYPING YOUR REASON MAKES YOU SELF-AWARE.

It's easy to lie to yourself clicking "just 5 more minutes." But when you have to TYPE "check how many likes my post got" or "scroll Instagram" - you suddenly realize: is this really what I need right now? The AI bouncer forces honest self-reflection before every distraction.

HOW IT WORKS:

🧠 AI DISTRACTION BOUNCER
Type why you need to unblock a site. The AI evaluates your reason and grants appropriate time.

• "Watch React tutorial" → ✅ 15 minutes
• "Check colleague's LinkedIn profile" → ⏰ Save to To-Do Reminders instead
• "Check weather" → ✅ 20 seconds
• "Scroll X feed" → ❌ Stay focused

⏱️ SMART TIME-BOXING
The AI determines how long you actually need. Quick lookup? 30 seconds. Following a tutorial? 15 minutes. You don't set timers—the AI does.

🔒 AUTO-REBLOCK
When time expires, all tabs redirect automatically. No "just 5 more minutes." No manual reblocking. Your focus session continues uninterrupted.

📝 TO-DO REMINDERS
Found something interesting but not urgent? Save it with one click. Getting Things Done-style: capture the distraction, clear your mind, check it during your break—not during deep work. The AI can even suggest saving instead of granting immediate access.

OTHER FEATURES:
🛡️ Strict Mode - Block EVERYTHING except your allowed work sites
🌙 Dark Mode - For comfortable night sessions
📥 SiteBlock Import - Migrate your settings in seconds
🔒 Zero tracking - Your data stays 100% private

PERFECT FOR:
• Students fighting social media during study sessions
• Developers who need time-boxed Stack Overflow access
• Remote workers building better focus habits
• Anyone tired of productivity tools with 50 features they never use

HOW TO USE:
Add distracting sites → Try to visit one → Explain why → Get time-boxed access → Auto-reblock when done.

No analytics dashboards. No Pomodoro timers. No gamification. Just intelligent blocking that works.
