## Detailed Description

THE FIRST SITE BLOCKER WITH AN AI BOUNCER

Block distracting sites, but with intelligence. When you need access, the AI decides if your reason is legitimate and grants precisely the time you need. No manual timers. No workarounds. No willpower battles.

HOW IT WORKS:

🧠 AI-DISTRACTION BOUNCER
Tell the AI why you need to unblock a site. It evaluates your reason and grants appropriate time.

• "Watch React tutorial" → ✅ 15 minutes
• "Bored" → ❌ Stay focused
• "Check weather" → ✅ 20 seconds
• "Browse YouTube" → ❌ Get back to work

⏱️ SMART TIME-BOXING
The AI determines how long you actually need. Quick lookup? 30 seconds. Following a tutorial? 15 minutes. You don't set timers—the AI does.

🔒 AUTO-REBLOCK
When time expires, all tabs redirect automatically. No "just 5 more minutes." No manual reblocking. Your focus session continues uninterrupted.

📝 TODO LIST FOR DISTRACTIONS
Found something interesting? Save it with one click. Getting Things Done-style: capture it, clear your mind, check it during your break—not during deep work.

OTHER FEATURES:
✅ Allow-Only Mode - Block everything except approved work sites
✅ Dark Mode - For night sessions
✅ SiteBlock Import - Migrate your settings in seconds
✅ No tracking or analytics - Your data stays private

PERFECT FOR:
• Students fighting social media during study sessions
• Developers who need time-boxed Stack Overflow access
• Remote workers building better focus habits
• Anyone tired of productivity tools with 50 features they never use

HOW TO USE:
Add distracting sites → Try to visit one → Explain why → Get time-boxed access → Auto-reblock when done.

No analytics dashboards. No Pomodoro timers. No gamification. Just intelligent blocking that works.
