### Version 1: Minimalism + Features

**The Minimal Site Blocker with a Brain**

Tired of bloated productivity tools with dozens of features you'll never use? MinimalBlock is different: just AI-powered blocking, time-boxed access, and auto-reblock. No analytics dashboards, no Pomodoro timers, no gamification. Just you, your work, and an AI that knows when you actually need access to blocked sites.

**⭐️ Why MinimalBlock is Different ⭐️**

🤖 **AI Validation (Not Rules)**
Our AI validates every unblock request. Need YouTube for a tutorial? Get 15 minutes. Want to scroll TikTok? Denied. No complex rule configuration needed—the AI just knows.

⏰ **Time-Boxed Access (20s to 60m)**
The AI grants precisely the time your task needs. Quick weather check? 20 seconds. Tutorial walkthrough? 15 minutes. No timers to set, no decisions to make.

🔒 **Auto-Reblock (Zero Willpower Required)**
When time expires, blocked sites redirect automatically—even on open tabs. You don't need self-control; the extension handles it.

✨ **Beautifully Simple**
Clean interface. Dark mode. No popups, no statistics, no achievement badges. Just a blocker that works and stays out of your way.

### Version 2: Benefits-Focused

**The Website Blocker That Actually Understands You**

Tired of site blockers that are either too strict or too easy to bypass? FocusGuard AI brings intelligence to distraction blocking with AI-powered validation and time-boxed access.

**The Problem with Traditional Site Blockers:**
❌ Too easy to disable when temptation strikes

❌ Require constant manual management

**The FocusGuard AI Solution:**
✅ AI guard that validates your unblock reasons
✅ Smart time-boxing: 20 seconds to 60 minutes based on your need
✅ Automatic reblock when time expires—even on open tabs
✅ Intelligent enough to know work from waste

**⭐️ Stand-Out Features ⭐️**

**🧠 AI Validation System**
Tell the AI why you need to access a blocked site. Working on a tutorial? Checking marketplace messages? You'll get just enough time to complete your task. Trying to procrastinate? The AI knows and keeps you on track.

**⏱️ Precision Time Control**
Get exactly the time you need:
• Quick lookups: 20-60 seconds

The magic happens automatically. When your approved time ends, all tabs with that site redirect to the block page. No manual intervention, no willpower battles, no "just five more minutes."

**📝 Todo Reminder System**

### Version 3: Conversational Tone

**Finally, a Site Blocker with a Brain**

You know the drill. You block YouTube and Twitter to get work done. Ten minutes later, you've convinced yourself you "need" to check something and disable the blocker. Sound familiar?

FocusGuard AI is different. It's the first website blocker with an AI guard that actually validates whether you need to access blocked sites.

**How the AI Guard Works:**

Trying to visit a blocked site? Tell the AI why.

"Need to watch a React tutorial" → ✅ Approved for 15 minutes
"Check what my friends are doing" → ❌ Get back to work
"Reply to marketplace message" → ✅ Approved for 3 minutes
"Just bored" → ❌ Nice try

The AI knows the difference between legitimate work and procrastination. And when it approves your request, you get precisely the time you need—not a second more.

**Auto-Reblock: The Secret Sauce**

Here's where it gets good. When your time expires, the site automatically reblocks. Even if you have 10 tabs open. Even if you're in the middle of scrolling. The page redirects to the block screen.

No more "I'll just finish this one video" that turns into an hour-long rabbit hole.

**Everything You Expect, Plus AI:**

✅ Block any website (social media, news, videos, games)
✅ Allow-Only Mode (block everything except work sites)
✅ Custom blocklists and allowlists
✅ Password protection (coming soon)
✅ Dark mode for late-night work
✅ Todo reminders for "check this later"
✅ One-click import from SiteBlock

**Built for Real Productivity:**

We're not trying to lock you away from the internet. We're helping you use it intentionally. Quick weather check? 20 seconds. Tutorial walkthrough? 15 minutes. The AI adapts to your actual needs.

**Privacy Matters:**

Your data is yours. The AI only sees the site you're accessing and your reason. No browsing history collection. No tracking. No selling your data.

**Try FocusGuard AI today and discover what focused work actually feels like.**

### Version 4: Anti-Bloat Positioning (RECOMMENDED)

**Finally, a Site Blocker That Isn't Bloated**

Most productivity extensions are ironic: they distract you with features while claiming to help you focus. MinimalBlock is the opposite.

**What we do:**
- AI validates your unblock reasons
- Grant time-boxed access (20s to 60m)
- Auto-reblock when time expires
- Done.

**What we DON'T do:**
- Track your "productivity score"
- Show you usage graphs
- Gamify your focus with points and streaks
- Force Pomodoro timers on you
- Clutter your screen with statistics
- Sell your data to advertisers

**Three Core Features. That's It.**

🧠 **AI Validation**
Type why you need to unblock a site. The AI decides if your reason is legitimate and grants appropriate time. No rule configuration, no scheduling complexity—just natural language.

Examples:
- "Watch React tutorial" → ✅ 15 minutes on YouTube
- "Bored" → ❌ Stay focused
- "Check weather" → ✅ 20 seconds
- "See what friends are doing" → ❌ Get back to work

⏱️ **Smart Time-Boxing**
The AI determines how much time your task actually needs. You don't set timers or configure durations. Quick lookup? 30 seconds. Tutorial? 15 minutes. The AI knows.

🔒 **Auto-Reblock**
When your time expires, all tabs with that blocked site redirect automatically. No willpower required. No "just 5 more minutes" negotiations with yourself.

**Bonus Features (Because They're Actually Useful):**
✅ Allow-Only Mode - Block the whole internet except work sites
✅ Todo Reminders - "Check this later" instead of breaking focus now
✅ Dark Mode - For night owls
✅ SiteBlock Import - Migrate in one click

**Who This Is For:**

This extension is for people who want to focus, not people who want to feel productive while configuring productivity tools.

If you want:
- Beautiful analytics dashboards → Use RescueTime
- Pomodoro timer integration → Use Forest
- Gamification and streaks → Use BlockSite
- A simple blocker with AI → **You're in the right place**

**Privacy:**
Your browsing data stays private. The AI only sees the site you're trying to access and your reason—nothing more. No tracking. No analytics. No data selling.

**Install in 30 seconds. Configure in 1 minute. Focus forever.**

Add your distracting sites → Try to visit one → Explain why to the AI → Get time-boxed access → Auto-reblock when done.

That's the entire workflow. No tutorials needed. No feature discovery. Just blocking that works.
