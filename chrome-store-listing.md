## Detailed Description

**Finally, a Site Blocker That Isn't Bloated**

Most productivity extensions are ironic: they distract you with features while claiming to help you focus. AI Site Blocker is the opposite.

**What we do:**
- AI validates your unblock reasons
- Grant time-boxed access (20s to 60m)
- Auto-reblock when time expires
- Done.

**What we DON'T do:**
- Track your "productivity score"
- Show you usage graphs
- Gamify your focus with points and streaks
- Force Pomodoro timers on you
- Clutter your screen with statistics
- Sell your data to advertisers

**Three Core Features. That's It.**

🧠 **AI Validation**
Type why you need to unblock a site. The AI decides if your reason is legitimate and grants appropriate time. No rule configuration, no scheduling complexity—just natural language.

Examples:
- "Watch React tutorial" → ✅ 15 minutes on YouTube
- "Bored" → ❌ Stay focused
- "Check weather" → ✅ 20 seconds
- "See what friends are doing" → ❌ Get back to work

⏱️ **Smart Time-Boxing**
The AI determines how much time your task actually needs. You don't set timers or configure durations. Quick lookup? 30 seconds. Tutorial? 15 minutes. The AI knows.

🔒 **Auto-Reblock**
When your time expires, all tabs with that blocked site redirect automatically. No willpower required. No "just 5 more minutes" negotiations with yourself.

**Bonus Features (Because They're Actually Useful):**
✅ Allow-Only Mode - Block the whole internet except work sites
✅ Todo Reminders - "Check this later" instead of breaking focus now
✅ Dark Mode - For night owls
✅ SiteBlock Import - Migrate in one click

**Who This Is For:**

This extension is for people who want to focus, not people who want to feel productive while configuring productivity tools.

If you want:
- Beautiful analytics dashboards → Use RescueTime
- Pomodoro timer integration → Use Forest
- Gamification and streaks → Use BlockSite
- A simple blocker with AI → **You're in the right place**

**Privacy:**
Your browsing data stays private. The AI only sees the site you're trying to access and your reason—nothing more. No tracking. No analytics. No data selling.

**Install in 30 seconds. Configure in 1 minute. Focus forever.**

Add your distracting sites → Try to visit one → Explain why to the AI → Get time-boxed access → Auto-reblock when done.

That's the entire workflow. No tutorials needed. No feature discovery. Just blocking that works.
