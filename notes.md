# FocusGuard - Block Site & Focus Mode

Free site blocker for enhanced productivity. Custom blocklist and password protection. Stay focused, and block distractions.

If you want some time to browse online but hope to avoid a full-blown internet spiral, a site blocker might be perfect for you.

Set a time limit for distracting sites. When you reach the limit, a block goes into place. That means you still get to check your feed now and then, just not for too long or too often.

Site blocker is designed to help you stay focused on studying, learning, and working. Blocks all time-westing websites to keep you productive and away from all the distractions the internet offers.

To use a site blocker, set a password, decide which websites you want access to, and let the site blocker block the rest. If you want to visit a site you have blocked, enter your password, and decide how long you want to be on the blocked site.

If you’re a parent, you can set the password for your child. Or, if you’d like to use it yourself, have a friend or partner put it for you to help you concentrate.

And voila! You now have a set of internet guardrails that help to help you stay productive and on task whether you’re studying, remote learning, or need an extra boost of self-control to finish a project.
